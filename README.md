- The goal of this project is to find six degrees of separation between people using certain dataset call 
"gplus_combined.txt" using graph algorithm such as BFS.
Access to the dataset: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Gplus.html
  - "gplus_combined.txt.gz"	is the name of the file in the link 
  
  
- readfile.rs -- Reads the file as an adjacency list
- bfs.rs -- Performs a Bredth-first search algorithm, and look for degrees of separation
- main.rs -- Contains code to run the project as well as test codes
- test.txt -- A txt file only for the test code
- Report pdf -- A pdf that includes: 
        General description of the project, What is does, How to run the project, What the output looks like, Analysis, and Conclusion
